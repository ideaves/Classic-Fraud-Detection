# Classic-Fraud-Detection
Python Jupyter presentation for Spark/Pandas

This can be viewed either as the Jupyter notebook version, with presentation, explanation, and context,
or as a straight python script, which can be run end to end in a simple python shell. It's a good showcase
because it applies qualitative aspects of data science to a common problem, and it presents a standard
PySpark and Pandas implementation. Which, surprisingly, requires a compatible JVM.

It takes some web log information and observed fraudulent purchase activity, and creates three categorical 
models to be able to estimate fraud classification for any web request. To present and explain the 
meaning of these models, type 1 and type 2 error, overfitting detection, and some hyperparameters are 
discussed. It's a good once-over of state-of-the-art as of a few years back.
